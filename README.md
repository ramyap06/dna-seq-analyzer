## Overall Idea
An online planner application which allows the user to add, change, and delete tasks.  It also allows for organization using tags such as due date, completion, priority, and class.  The planner can be view in at least two different frameworks, one being a calendar and another a weekly planner.

## Implementation of CS 180

### File I/O
Each user's task data will be loaded and saved in a file for easy access and memory purposes.

### Network I/0
Be able to access the planner from different computers / machines (very tentative!)

### Concurrency
Uses threads to update tasks in the background when the user interacts with the interface.

### GUI
* Calendar and weekly planner frame
* Buttons such as add task
* Textbox for picking a date and possibly time
* Drop down for selecting tags such as class, priority, and 
* Colors to make it more user-friendly
